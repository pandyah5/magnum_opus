        So this is where we present to you the art pieces that we and our dear

        The City of Hope

    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        This piece is created by using Neural Style Transfer which amalgamates the bright countryside sunrise into the busy concrete jungle.
        The picture captures the emotions that flow through ones heart when he/she explores a new city - full of adventure, opportunity and hope...

        The Angry God

        <img src="./Final sketches/the_angry_god.PNG" alt="A painting named 'The Angry God'" height=640px width=100% border=10px border-color=black>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        In many ancient civilizations, the solar deity (or the Sun God) was worshiped as a symbol of power and strength. Many mythological tales also touch on the Sun God's anger.
        This art piece uses delaunay triangulation - a mathematical algorithm, to recreate the aspect of anger in an early sunrise.

        The Haunted City of Toronto

    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        Art is often the depiction of the artist, and this picture captures the memory of my first ever halloween experience in the beautiful city of Toronto.
        The piece has been created in collaboration with Mr. Pistachio.

        The ConFlicTed Soul

        <img src="./Final sketches/The_conflicted_soul.jpg" alt="A painting named 'The Haunted City of Toronto'" height=640px width=100% border=10px border-color=black>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        This piece demonstrates how the human soul is a combination of both the dark and the light, signifying chaos and peace. There always exists a devil in peace and an angel in chaos.
        The art piece incorporates a mathematical concept called fractals and metaphorical contrast styles to deliver its message.

        The City of Gold
    </div>

        <img src="./Final sketches/city_of_gold.png" alt="A painting named 'The Haunted City of Toronto'" height=640px width=100% border=10px border-color=black>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        Since ancient times, gold is seen as a metaphor for wealth and prosperity. In the mordern world of today, urban development
        often equates to prosperity and wealth. Merging the two ideas
         Mr. Pistachio and myself worked on creating the mordern city on a gold foil texture, the superposition of the new on the old...

        The Darker Reflection
    </div>
    <div class="img">
        <img src="./Final sketches/dark_sea.png" alt="A painting named 'The Haunted City of Toronto'" height=640px width=100% border=10px border-color=black>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes">
        The darker reflection showcases dual personalities. It expresses the fact that everything in existence including nature
        have a proportion of good and evil in them. For every bright blue sky there is a mysteriously dark ocean.
        Unlike other art pieces the meaning of this art resides in the texture rather than the content.

        The Art And The Artist
    </div>
    <div class="img2">
        <img src="./Final sketches/art_with_its_artist.png" alt="A painting named 'The Haunted City of Toronto'" height=790px width=50% border=10px border-color=black>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imgDes2">
        This is a picture of a painter painting a picture, painted in the style of the picture. Read that again! The style of the
        art is similar to the piece the painter is seen painting, thereby creating a recursive style loop.
        Again Mr. Pistachio is the one who translated this unique imagination to an art.
