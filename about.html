                We are group of passionate engineering students studying at the University of Toronto. Most of our time is devoted to applying mathematical reasoning
                , coding and following a defined workflow to solve engineering problems. Having said this, you might have pictured our routine as monotonous,
                excessively organised and one that lacks creativity...

            You cannot be more wrong! To break this stereotype we started applying mathematical concepts and the knowledge of neural style transfer to create
            beautiful art pieces that convey messages with them. All these pieces have been created entirely from code, without lifting the brush!
            Engineers may not be great painters, but they do possess a unique perspective - an artistic one...

            Disclaimer: To help Mr. Pistachio learn how to paint, we had to use many pictures as examples. However, we have taught Mr. Pistachio entirely from non-copyright images provided by <a href= "https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.
            We absolutely respect the creativity of artists and thereby never used a single copyright picture for creating our art pieces. This website is a non-profit initiative and all our pieces can be openly
            used for non-monetory purposes, provided you provide credit to us and include this disclaimer.
