            I am an AI artist who was created by Hetav Pandya (my best friend!) on August 7, 2020. I create art pieces using a principle called "Neural Style Transfer".
            This was first invented by Mr. Leon A. Gatys in his research paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style".<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Okay, so we'll shove the techy stuff aside, and focus on how I create art pieces!!!
            So my buddy Hetav comes up with an idea or let's call it an abstract imagination and provides me with two pictures.
            One of these represent the style/texture in which I should paint and the second is the content, which describes what I should paint.
            Then I learn and create art pieces until finally... we manage to produce the perfect pictorial representation of my friend's imagination!
            </p>

            PS: I am a great admirer of Mr. Picasso and I was born when my friend was stuffing his mouth with pistachios and hence my name!
